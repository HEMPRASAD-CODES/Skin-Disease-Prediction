## Skin Disease Prediction Project Overview

**Objective:**  
The project aims to develop a deep learning pipeline for automated classification of skin lesions using the HAM10000 dataset. The goal is to accurately identify seven different types of skin diseases from dermoscopic images[1].

**Dataset:**  
- **HAM10000:** Contains 10,015 dermoscopic images labeled with one of seven skin lesion categories:
  - nv (melanocytic nevi)
  - mel (melanoma)
  - bkl (benign keratosis-like lesions)
  - bcc (basal cell carcinoma)
  - akiec (actinic keratoses)
  - vasc (vascular lesions)
  - df (dermatofibroma)
- Each entry includes metadata such as patient age, sex, and lesion localization[1].

**Key Steps and Methods:**
- **Data Exploration:**  
  The notebook explores class distribution, patient demographics, and visualizes the dataset to understand its balance and diversity.
- **Preprocessing:**  
  - **Hair Removal:** Uses morphological operations and inpainting to remove hair artifacts from images, improving image clarity for model training.
  - **Image Normalization and Resizing:** All images are resized (e.g., to 32x32 or 224x224 pixels) and normalized for neural network input.
- **Modeling:**  
  - Utilizes deep learning models, specifically EfficientNetB3, leveraging transfer learning for robust feature extraction.
  - Employs data augmentation to increase training data variability and reduce overfitting.
- **Training and Evaluation:**  
  - The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets.
  - Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report, and ROC-AUC scores.
  - Class imbalance is addressed using class weights during training[1].
- **Technical Stack:**  
  - Python (TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn, OpenCV)
  - Jupyter Notebook
  - Visualization tools (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
  - Hardware acceleration with GPU support

**Results:**  
- The notebook reports successful loading and preprocessing of all 10,015 images.
- The pipeline demonstrates the ability to process large-scale medical image datasets, apply advanced preprocessing (like hair removal), and train state-of-the-art deep learning models for multi-class classification of skin diseases[1].

**Significance:**  
This project provides a reproducible and scalable approach for skin disease detection, which can be valuable for clinical decision support and teledermatology applications.
